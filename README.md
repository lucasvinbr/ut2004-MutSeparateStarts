# ut2004-MutSeparateStarts
UT2004 mutator that attempts to, in team games, separate the teams' spawn points. It can also spawn control points, which can be taken in order to enable another spawn point for your team.

The mod has only been tested in single player, and does not seem to be compatible with the TDMEverywhere gametype. It also doesn't go well with Assault and Onslaught because those gametypes already control spawns.
